# Mindful Connect

Mindful Connect is a meditation tracking and social platform consisting of an iOS app and a companion website.

A small HTML/JavaScript timer is included under the `web/` folder so the basic timing functionality can also be used in the browser. Open `web/index.html` to try it locally.
