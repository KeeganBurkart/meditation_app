# Minimalist Design Language

The Mindful Connect interface uses a calm and distraction-free aesthetic. The guiding principles are:

- **Soft color palette**: cool grays and tranquil blues (#F8FAFA, #E6EFF1, #C9D6D9, #5A7D7C).
- **Ample whitespace** to encourage focus on the content.
- **Simple typography**: use a single sans-serif font family like *SF Pro* or *Roboto* with limited weights.
- **Subtle rounded corners** on interface elements to create a friendly feel.
- **Limited iconography** and no excessive gradients or shadows.

Components should be spaced generously and avoid clutter. Text and primary actions use high contrast against the background while supporting elements are muted.
