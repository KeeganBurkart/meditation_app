# Supportive Copy Samples

The tone of Mindful Connect is warm and encouraging. Use language that motivates users without judgment.

- "Great job taking a moment for yourself today!"
- "Keep breathing, you're doing wonderfully."
- "Each session is a step on your journey toward mindfulness."
- "Remember: consistency is more important than perfection."

Short messages should remind users that progress is personal and every attempt counts.
